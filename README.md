# MLOps: The Production Pipelines of Machine Learning Models

Advances in Machine Learning are emerging rapidly in every industry, however that does not mean it is achieved without new challenges. As these solutions are becoming a standard, when deploying and tracking them in a production environment we find significant challenges as the model performance tends to decay over time, this phenomenon is also known as model performance drift. Quite often models deployed over a period of time experience such challenges that can derive from the target variable and/or data distribution drifted its behaviour when compared to the moment that model was initially deployed. In this talk we will talk about how we can mitigate model and data drifts using strategic design when deploying our solutions, and which tools can help us achieve this objective.
